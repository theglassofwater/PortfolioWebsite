# PortfolioWebsite
My Portfolio Web Application, the project currently displays details such as projects and contact details.

Django with Rest Framework\
React with Axios (react hook form, @hookform/resolvers, yup )\


Project section shows my Music Generator project, where transformer 60m model is used to generate music, it is then synthisised (from midi to playable audio(mp3)). This whole process is done server side(generating the song and synthisising the .mid file).

Next Goals: 

Frontend: 
Go through each section/component and make it better\
Make new page for playing around with certain projects eg. generating music (this is the end goal of this website)\

Backend:
Make contact messages work (i actually receive the messages)\
Store Contact details and message, (Maybe store email and name as a user)\

Overall:
CI/CD Pipeline\
Deploy
