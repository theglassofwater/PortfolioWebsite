# PortfolioWebsite
My Portfolio Web Application, displays details such as projects and the ability to contact me.

Django with Rest Framework <br />
React with Axios (react hook form, @hookform/resolvers, yup, react three fiber ) <br />

Project section shows my Music Generator project, where transformer 60m model is used to generate music, it is then synthisised (from midi to playable audio(mp3)). This whole process is done server side(generating the song and synthisising the .mid file).

Next Goals: 

Frontend: <br />
Go through each section/component and add UI Component libraries <br />

Backend: <br />
Make contact messages work (i actually receive the messages)<br />

Overall:<br />
CI/CD Pipeline<br />
Deploy<br />
