# PortfolioWebsite
My Portfolio Web Application, the project currently displays details such as projects and contact details.

Next Goals: 
Frontend: 
Add header and footer
Go through each section/component and make it better
Make sections for playing around with certain projects eg. generating music (this is the end goal of this website)

Backend:
Make contact messages work (i actually receive the messages)
Store Contact details and message, (Maybe store email and name as a user)
